# Bank Database

## Overview

Bank Database Design and Implementation with SQL
* This project was part of my Database Design & Implementation coursework. In this project, I created a database for a banking institution right from requirement gathering, designing of logical models, forward engineering, and data entry to database implementation and writing queries to pull information from the database.
* After gathering requirements for the banking database, I created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to model the tables and relationship. The ERD was developed into a Logical Data Model (LDM) where many-to-many relationship was resolved and Primary Keys (PKs), Foreign Keys (FKs) and Primary Foreign Keys (PKFs) were identified.
* An EER Model was designed on MySQL based on the Logical Data Model (LDM) depicting the relationship between the entities in the database.
* After the EER model was completed, I generated a schema on MySQL using forward engineering.
* Data was then entered into the various tables based on the table dependencies.
* SQL queries were written and implemented to pull data from the database to answer some common questions for the bank.

## Technologies Used
